# Travel-Agency-Management-System


This project aims to create a C++ "Travel Agency Management System" program. Where I have to generate MENU options. This MENU option includes two classes named New Travel Trip and Show All User, two functions Edit User & Delete User under New Travel Trip, & three more functions Add Trip, Edit Trip & Delete Trip under the class of Show All User. But I have added a new MENU option called Exit Program to terminate the program.

This Developed object-oriented program in C++ to create a Travel Agency Management System (TAMS) with the following information read from the keyboard:
Now with choice enter the following information. 

• New Travel Trip –
Invoice ID (Auto-serial no) + Enter Date + Enter User Name + Enter User Address + Enter User Phone No. (11 digit) + Enter User Email Address + Enter Trip Date + Enter Trip Location (Start location and Final Destination)

• Show All Users, Delete User, Edit User –
Enter Invoice ID + Enter Date + Enter User Name + Enter User Address + Enter User Phone No. (11 digit) + Enter User Email Address + Enter Trip Date + Enter Trip Location (Start location and Final Destination)

• Add Trip, Edit Trip, Delete Trip –
Enter Invoice ID + Enter Trip Date + Enter Trip Location (Start location and Final Destination) 

Please, Choose Your Option:

New Travel Trip.
Show All Users.
Edit User.
Delete User.
Add Trip.
Edit Trip.
Delete Trip. Enter Your Choice: _
Exit Menu

To solve this project named "Travel Agency Management System," I have created a MENU that includes eight options such as New Travel, Show All User, Edit User, Delete User, Add Trip, Edit Trip, Delete Trip, and Exit Program. In this program, I have created two classes named New Travel Trip and Show All User. I have declared three function named Add Trip(), Edit Trip() & Delete Trip() in the New Travel Trip Class section. I have declared two constructors in the New Travel
Trip class: the "Default Constructor" and another is "Parameterized Constructor." 

In the Show All User class, I have also declared three more functions, and these are Show User(), Delete User(), and Edit User(). In the main function, I have used a switch statement to show the option MENU. In this project, I have used four header files. The first one is <iostream>; this header file provides basic input and output services. The second one is <vector>; this header file is used for a contiguous storage location for their elements. The second last is <conio.h>; the CONIO stands for Console Input Output, which has functions like getch(). The getch() function holds the output screen for some time until the user passes a key from the keyboard to exit the console screen.

And the last one is <cstdlib>; this header file declares a set of general-purpose functions such as exit() function. The exit() function works to terminate the program.
